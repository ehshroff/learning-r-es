# Feedback on your BMI script

Great work on being able to follow the coding syntax that we discussed during the sessions. I see that you are following and are able to get familiar with the syntax. Please do let me know if you have questions or want to discuss in more detail the code.

Following are more specific bullet points of what you have done well and what you can consider doing next time as you progress with your work in R.

## 1. Don't forget about which objects names to use for calculations

In line 11 of your code, it errors because the divisor in the equation is using `bmi_a` which you have not created yet. I think that is supposed to be `height_a`


## 2. Give your code some breathing space and make it more readable

This is not a big issue as it is a style preference but I think it is important. Your code can use some more spacing in between lines especially when it is a new topic or new task. This helps reader/reviewer/collaborator read your code well.
